subtitle: <a href='#'>Hi!</a> Iâ€™m a second-year PhD student in Information Sciences at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign ([UIUC personal webpage](https://ischool.illinois.edu/people/zhiwen-jerome-you)). I am fortunately co-advised by [Dr. Yue Guo](https://yueguo-50.github.io/) and [Dr. Jana Diesner](https://jdiesnerlab.ischool.illinois.edu/). I also received my Master degree from UIUC. I'm an alumni of [The Center for Artificial Intelligence Innovation (CAII)](https://ai.ncsa.illinois.edu/) at National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA).


## <a href='#'>Research Interests</a>

I broadly work within the scope of Natural Language Processing and AI for Health.

Some of my current interests include:

- **Factuality evaluation and mitigation in summarization**, especially in biomedical and health domains. Standard factuality evaluation approaches fail to evaluate hallucinated but factual information that is not stated in the source documents. How to leverage the domain-specific knowledge to accurately detect such content and mitigate factual errors in LLM-generated summaries?

- **Bias / Fairness of Large Language Models**. LLM-generated content can be biased in various dimensions, such as gender, ethics, morality, and more. How those biases are encoded and produced inside the internal representations of LLMs? Can we modify and control them?
